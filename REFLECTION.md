1. **DONE:** Chose 2048 and Space Invaders as our games. Formatted start screen with a button to execute 2048. Made art for the start screen. 

2. **TODO:** Finish start screen. Create logic for 2048.

3. **PROB:** Had trouble with formatting images. We are still having some problems with making the screen appear to our vision.
